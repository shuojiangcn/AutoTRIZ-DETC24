### The TRIZ Case Base

From seven TRIZ-related textbooks, we collected ten initial cases for the evaluation of AutoTRIZ. The ten cases cover various domains, including environmental engineering, transportation, manufacturing and material science, and aerospace technology.

### Case 1

- **Reference:** Michael A. Orloff, Modern TRIZ, Page 187.
- **Problem Description:** To prevent water erosion of river banks, they can be strengthened with stones. However, water gradually washes sand and soil from under the stones, and the shoreline collapses. What can we do?
- **Improving Feature:** (32, 'Ease of manufacture')
- **Worsening Feature:** (30, 'External harm affects the object')
- **Identified Principles:** [(2, 'Extraction'), (24, 'Mediator')]
- **Solutions:**

```
Solution 1:
Utilized Principle: [(24, 'Mediator')]
Content: The stones are fixed with durable mesh wire. Moreover, the stones can be placed inside prefabricated sections similar to mesh wire baskets â€“ thereby giving the construction the required shape and size.
